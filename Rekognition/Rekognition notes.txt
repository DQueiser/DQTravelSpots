Two commands:
aws rekognition detect-labels --image "S3Object={Bucket=dqueiserbucket1,Name=DSC02694.jpg}" --region us-east-2
This command does work
aws s3 ls


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AWS Rekognition is a cloud-based computer-vision service that has been around since 2016.
 - Computer-vision is a field that works with machine-learning via digital images
	and videos, or as they term it "dealing with how computers can be made to gain
	a high-level understanding".
 - Computer-vision includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding
	digital images, and extracting high-dimensional data from those images and videos


Rekognition is available as a service on the AWS Console (which I will show), an API which
	can be called, and also via the AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Rekognition has a number of computer-vision capabilities, falling into two categories:
	1) Pre-trained algorithims that operate on data collected by Amazon
	2) Algorithims that users can train on a custom dataset

Pre-trained algorithims:
1) Object and scene detection
2) Celebrity Recognition: Just what it sounds like
3) Facial attribute detection: identifies attributes such as gender, age-range, emotions,
	and facial features (facial hair, glasses, etc.)
4) People pathing: done using a video, such as sports players in a game video
5) Text detection: Just what it sounds like
6) Image moderation, or unsafe content detection


User-trained algorithims using custom datasets:
1) Search Faces, using a database of images: think a personal family tree
2) Face-based user verification: maybe unlock your front door?

Rekognition has also been used by law-enforcement, with some controversy. The ACLU has
 gotten involved in a number of cases.
Also, some gender/race biases have been suggested, indicating that the software does better
 on male faces and is less reliable on dark-skinned females.

Worth noting that the software needs images/videos to be 5MB or smaller (or 15MB if on S3).
 Most high-resolution cameras (which is most new ones) have considerably larger file-sizes
 to capture more data.


My trials with the CLI - getting an access error
Two commands:
aws rekognition detect-labels --image "S3Object={Bucket=dqueiserbucket1,Name=DSC02694.jpg}" --region us-east-2
This command does work
aws s3 ls

detect-labels (basic object-detection)
compare-faces (takes two images as input)


API returns JSON and
