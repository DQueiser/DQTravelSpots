# Screen Design

### 1: Login page

This will be the first page displayed. Users can enter their email-address username and password, or can click a button to sign up as a new user.

### 2: New User page

If the new user option is chosen from the login page, this page will be displayed. New users can enter their first and last names, email address, and a password which they will need to enter twice in order to confirm it.

### 3: About page

Will display information about this application.

### 4: Search page

On this page users will enter a country/city combination, with the option of also entering a state. I intend on using an API to provide the list of countries and cities.

### 5: Search Results page

This page will list off the results returned by the ViaMichelin API. The user will have the option of saving Points of Interest by city.

### 6: User Trip List

This page will list off all of the Cities that the user has saved Points of Interest for, with a count of how many POIs each saved city has.

### 7: User Trip breakdown list

This page will list off all Points of Interest that a user has saved for a geographic city.
