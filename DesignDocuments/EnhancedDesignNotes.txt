Web pages
~~~~~~~~~

1) Login
 - Registered users can enter their email address and password - which need to be verified - 
	and then log in
 - Unregistered users can click a button which will allow them to register

2) NewUser
 - New users will enter their First and last names, email address, and a password (twice)

3) About
 - This page will show information about this application

4) Search
 - This page will allow a user to enter or select a city/country/state to search for
 - Ideally this will connect to an API to populate the dropdown of Country and City

5) Search Results
 - When a successful search is completed, this page will display the results in a easy-to-read
	format. For each Point Of Interest, users will have the ability to rate it (with a star
	line) and save it to their saved trips.

6) User Trip List
 - Users can link to this page, which will display a list of the city locations they have 
	saved POIs for. It will also show the number of POIs that they have marked as well
	as the last time they saved a POI for that location

7) User Trip Breakdown
 - When a user selects one of their saved trips from #6, that trip will display here with 
	all of its POIs. This screen will be similar to #5.

Also, I think I would like

8) Main
 - I think it would be helpful to bring start with a Main page, once a user has logged in.
 - It can have some generic info, some suggested cities, and links to the various other pages.

9) Add POI?
 - It might be helpful to allow users to enter their own POI for a city.
 - This could possibly involve another table, which I would search in conjunction with the API
