# Weekly Reflection

Original note: Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles. 


### Week 1

9/4/2019 - 5.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Reviewed numerous APIs for suitability
 
During the first week I was more focused on watching the Week 1 videos and getting my laptop set up for class, and so I did not spend a lot of time on the Independent Project. During the first class session, I got a good feel for what will be expected for this project. Based on that, I decided that my project should revolve around one of my outside interests, particularly travel or photography (or both).

I then spent time reviewing numerous API websites to find a suitable candidate for my project. I did not have any luck locating exactly what I was looking for. This is exactly what happens any time I go shopping for one specific thing. I didn't find any particular API that sang to me.


### Week 2

9/11/2019 - 9.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Reviewed APIs on ProgrammableWeb.com
 * Created this repository 
 * Drafted my problem statement

During the second class session, I was pointed to ProgrammableWeb as a good source of APIs. I then spent some time searching through it looking for candidate APIs. None had jumped out at me before we met for class the next time. Using the example from the FatBikeTrailReport sample, I began drafting my problem statement.


### Week 3

9/18/2016 - 12 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Selected API from ProgrammableWeb listings
 * Completed my problem statement
 * Drafted my user stories
 * Wrote out my project plan, which may be modified as needed
 * Began this weekly reflection document
 * Write out designs for my screens in text form
