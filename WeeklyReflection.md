# Weekly Reflection

Original note: Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles. 


### Week 1

9/4/2019 - 5.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Chose a project goal
 * Reviewed numerous APIs for suitability
 
During the first week I was more focused on watching the Week 1 videos and getting my laptop set up for class, and so I did not spend a lot of time on the Independent Project. During the first class session, I got a good feel for what will be expected for this project. Based on that, I decided that my project should revolve around one of my outside interests, particularly travel or photography (or both).

I then spent time reviewing numerous API websites to find a suitable candidate for my project. I did not have any luck locating exactly what I was looking for. This is exactly what happens any time I go shopping for one specific thing. I didn't find any particular API that sang to me.


### Week 2

9/11/2019 - 9.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Reviewed APIs on ProgrammableWeb.com
 * Created this repository 
 * Drafted my problem statement

During the second class session, I was pointed to ProgrammableWeb as a good source of APIs. I then spent some time searching through it looking for candidate APIs. None had jumped out at me before we met for class the next time. Using the example from the FatBikeTrailReport sample, I began drafting my problem statement.


### Week 3

9/18/2016 - 12 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Selected API from ProgrammableWeb listings
 * Completed my problem statement
 * Drafted my user stories
 * Wrote out my project plan, which may be modified as needed
 * Began this weekly reflection document
 * Write out designs for my screens in text form


### Week 4

9/25/2019 - 8 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Reviewed additional APIs on ProgrammableWeb.com
 * Updated design document 
 * Began working on Java Classes

This week I took a deeper dive on my Project Plan and associated design documents. I mapped out in more detail what each Java Class would need, the specifics of the database tables, and each of the JSPs. I began to code the Java Classes, but did not proceed too far; I focused on the weekly exercise which would be helpful when coding my project.


### Week 5

10/2/2019 - 6.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Coded two Java classes
 * Set up initial MySQL database with three tables 
 * Coded Hibernate configuration

This week I worked mainly on the second Hibernate exercise; since Hibernate is so important for this project I wanted to be sure I had a good understanding of it before I got too far along on this project. Once I had that exercise completed I began setting up the configuration within my independent project.


### Week 6

10/9/2019 - 15 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Coded two more Java classes
 * Tested with my test database 

Things are starting to shape up. The exercise for Week 5 was immensely helpful. I am setting up more classes and hope to begin working on DAOs prior to Wednesday evening.


### Week 7

10/16/2019 - 25 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Coded three DAOs (not using a generic one at this time)
 * Coded two TestDAOs and ran them
 * Tested with my test database 

It was a big success to get the TestDAOs actually running. One setback was that when I created my project, the folders were not marked as Source, TestSource, etc. But a quick Google search helped me get that straightened out, and it only took a matter of minutes/clicks and I was able to run my first tests.

### Week 8

10/23/2019 - 20 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Authentication added

Short week this week, so I rolled the Authentication from last week into this project.

### Week 9

10/30/2019 - 18 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Added a data lookup and display, including a servlet.

For some reason adding a simple data lookup to this project turned into a beat-my-head-against-the-wall expedition. But at the last minute, with some help from Paula, it started to work all over the place. So I quickly deployed it to AWS and ran far away from the laptop so as not to screw it up before class time. And also, our Trunk-or-Treat contribution turned out meh, but my daughter was happy. On to the next hurdle.

### Week 10

11/6/2019 - 2 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * None

This week was all about getting caught up with Week 9 activities as well as working on the group project. I looked at setting up a generic DAO, but spent no time on it.

### Week 11

11/13/2019 - 16.5 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * Added a generic DAO and tested.

Much of this week was again spent on the group project - my task was setting up test cases - as well as doing research for my professional presentation. I am learning a lot about AWS Rekognition, although I am not sure if I wil have an app pointing to it by 11/27. There is a sample app on the AWS website which I can use, in any case. This week I added a generic DAO to my independent project and tested with it.  I will be focused on the JSPs over the next week or so.

### Week 12

11/20/2019 - 0.0 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * None

This week was devoted to working on the Group Project prior to its demonstration. Class day was my birthday so I am now officially 1/4 of the way through my life span. Class day was spent seeing Ford v Ferrari and hanging out in bookstores, while assisting the group revamp our project.

### Week 13

11/27/2019 - 0.0 hours

Tasks Completed:
 * None

This week was devoted to prepping for my presentation on AWS Rekognition. Also, we had a full dress rehearsal at the dance studio for our Nutcracker show.

### Week 14

12/4/2019 - 9.0 hours so far

Tasks Completed:
 * JSPs fleshed out
 * New user capability has been cleaned up

Preparing for the code review in class tonight. Have all JSPs in place (although not fully constructed). Two weeks to finish this puppy.
