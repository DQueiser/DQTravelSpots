# Problem Statement


### Vision

I enjoy seeing travelers independently plan their own outings and vacations, because I think it exposes the average person to more out-of-the way, hidden travel gems around the world.

### Issue

Today many websites help travelers tackle the mechanics of getting from Point A to Point B -  airfare sites, car rentals, hotel websites - but few assist them in deciding what those places all have to offer. Smaller operations, new startups, and regional points of interest can easily be overlooked and missed.

### Method

I will use the ViaMichelin API in conjunction with my own database to allow users to search geographic areas for points of interest when planning their travels.
